## This course introduces the underlying statistical and algorithmic principles required to develop scalable real-world machine learning pipelines by using Apache Spark to implement several scalable learning pipelines with Python pySpark API

Lab1 covers bulding a simple word count application of the most common words in the Complete Works of William Shakespeare retrieved from Project Gutenberg using Spark.

Lab1 covers Math and Python review in numpy.

Lab2 demonstrates how easy it is to perform web server log analysis with Apache Spark.

Lab3 covers a common supervised learning pipeline, using a subset of the Million Song Dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository training a linear regression model to predict the release year of a song given a set of audio features.

Lab4 covers the steps for creating a click-through rate (CTR) prediction pipeline using the Criteo Labs dataset that was used for a Kaggle competition in 2014.

Lab5 delves into exploratory analysis of neuroscience data, specifically using principal component analysis (PCA) and feature-based aggregation using a dataset of light-sheet imaging recorded by the Ahrens Lab at Janelia Research Campus, and hosted on the CodeNeuro data repository.
